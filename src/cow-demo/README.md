# Cow Demo Application

[![Docker Image Version](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/devprofr/cow-demo?label=Docker)](https://hub.docker.com/r/devprofr/cow-demo)

ðŸ’¡ This is a hard fork of [oskapt/rancher-demo](https://github.com/oskapt/rancher-demo) who hasn't been updated since 2021.

This is a Go demo application used for demonstrating Kubernetes and load balancing.

It will create a colored icon for each replica within a ReplicaSet and indicate which one most recently served a response.
Replicas which haven't been heard from will begin to fade out, until after a configurable number of seconds they will disappear.
This is useful for demonstrating scaling up/down an upgraded application.

## How to configure

Environment variables:

- `TITLE`: sets title in demo app
- `SHOW_VERSION`: show version of app in ui (`VERSION` env var)
- `REFRESH_INTERVAL`: interval in milliseconds for page to refresh (default: 1000)
- `EXPIRE_INTERVAL`: how long a replica can go without being seen before we remove it from the display (default: 10s)
- `REMOVE_INTERVAL`: how long after `EXPIRE_INTERVAL` until we remove the icon (default: 20s)
- `SKIP_ERRORS`: set this to prevent errors from counting (useful on janky load balancers)
- `METADATA`: extra text at bottom of info area
- `COW_COLOR`: what color the cow background should be (default: black). Valid options are any color from the CSS pallete, including:
  - red
  - orange
  - yellow
  - olive
  - green
  - teal
  - blue
  - violet
  - purple
  - pink
  - black

### How to test

Run in a terminal:

```bash
go test -v ./...
```

### How to run locally

Build the application:

```bash
go build
```

Start the web server:

````bash
COW_COLOR=purple ./cow-demo
````

Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### How to run in a container

The container image is using [SUSE BCI (Base Container Images)](https://registry.suse.com/).

Build a local image:

```bash
docker build -t devprofr/cow-demo .
```

Start a container:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -e COW_COLOR:purple devprofr/cow-demo
```

Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Paths

By default the loaded page will reach back to `/demo` every `REFRESH_INTERVAL` and use the returned information to update the display. Other paths are:

- `/info` - returns some additional information about the replica serving the request
- `/load` - adds a 2s delay to the response from `/info` - use this for putting artificial load on the system and watching the replicas scale

## Backlog

* Upgrade [urfave/cli](https://cli.urfave.org/) to v2
* Upgrade [semantic-ui](https://semantic-ui.com/) ("2.2.13") to 2.4
